Conda env: ml_project           * /user1/supriyo/miniconda3/envs/ml_project
==========================================

Pipeline:
  1. Load 539 full 2D spectral cubes (1000 x 2762)
  2. Extract Mean + Std features (5524 dims)
  3. Train SNPE neural posterior
  4. Expected: R² > 0.7 for xHI, > 0.85 for fX

Why 2D Data:
  ✓ Contains full spectral line-of-sight information
  ✓ Preserves texture and structure
  ✓ Mean+Std captures distribution shape
  ✓ Much richer than 1D mean spectrum

STEP 4: TRAIN SNPE WITH 2D SPECTRAL DATA (Full Cubes)
======================================================================

1. Loading split dataset...

   x_train_1d shape: torch.Size([427, 2762]) (mean spectrum)
   x_train_2d shape: torch.Size([427, 1000, 2762]) (full cube)
   theta_val shape: torch.Size([107, 2])
   x_val_2d shape: torch.Size([107, 1000, 2762])

2. Flattening 2D spectral cubes...
   Flattened training: torch.Size([427, 2762000])
   Flattened validation: torch.Size([107, 2762000])
   Total features per sample: 2762000

3. Applying smart dimensionality reduction...
   Mean + Std features: torch.Size([427, 5524])
   - Mean spectrum: 2762 features
   - Std spectrum: 2762 features
   Total: 5524 features (rich representation!)

4. Normalizing features...
   ✓ Normalized training data
   ✓ Normalized validation data

   Dataset summary:
   - Training samples: 427
   - Validation samples: 107
   - Input features: 5524 (Mean+Std of 2D cubes)
   - Parameter dimension: 2 (xHI, fX)

5. Defining prior...
   Prior: xHI ∈ [0, 1], fX ∈ [-4, 1]

6. Initializing SNPE...

7. Training with OPTIMIZED hyperparameters:
   batch_size: 16
   learning_rate: 0.0005
   num_epochs: 1000
   Input data: 2D cubes (mean + std)
   Feature dim: 5524 (2x richer than 1D mean)
   Expected: SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER R²

8. Training neural posterior with 2D spectral data...
   This will take 2-4 hours on CPU...
   Rich 2D data should yield MUCH BETTER posteriors...

✅ STEP 4 COMPLETE - 2D DATA TRAINING!
======================================================================

Training Summary:
  - Trained on: 427 samples
  - Validated on: 107 samples
  - Model saved: /user1/supriyo/Simulation_Based_Inference_on_21cm_FAST/SBI_step_by_step/UGMRT_500h/Outputs/Train_outputs/posterior_snpe_2d.pt
  - Input dimension: 5524 features (Mean + Std of 2D cubes)
  - batch_size: 16, lr: 0.0005, epochs: 1000

Key Improvements:
  ✓ 2D spectral cubes (1000 x 2762) instead of 1D mean
  ✓ Mean + Std features capture distribution information
  ✓ 5524 features (2x more than 1D mean)
  ✓ Much richer information for learning
  ✓ Very many epochs (1000) for convergence

Why 2D Data is Better:
  - Contains line-of-sight variance information
  - Captures texture/structure in 21cm signal
  - Mean+Std gives distribution shape, not just mean value
  - Helps network distinguish parameter differences better

Target Metrics:
  - xHI R²: >0.70 (was 0.31)
  - fX R²: >0.85 (was 0.69)

Next: Run Step 4b evaluation to check improvements
